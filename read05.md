  Images
 adding images to your page will make the page look more attractive to the user and also images can says a lot of thing.

to add images to your html page you need to :

<img> This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes:

src This tells the browser where it can find the image file. This will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your own site. (Here you can see that the images are in a child folder called images — relative URLs were covered on pages 83-84). 
alt This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.

title You can also use the title attribute with the  element to provide additional information about the image.

Most browsers will display the content of this attribute in a too tip when the user hovers over the image.

You should save images at the size you will be using them on the web page and in the appropriate format. 

Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.Color

Color can really bring your pages to life it also convey the mood and evokes reactions.

- There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:
RGB values.
Hex codes
Color names.
- Color pickers can help you find the color you want.

- It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).

- CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.

-CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. 

 <h1 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Hello World</h1>
 
 <p style="background-color:Tomato;">Lorem ipsum...</p>
 
 
 
Text
The properties that allow you to control the appearance of text can be split into two groups:

● Those that directly affect the font and its appearance (including the typeface, whether it is regular, bold or italic, and the size of the text)
● Those that would have the same effect on text no matter what font you were using (including the color of text and the spacing between words and letters)

In CSS there are five generic font families:
Serif fonts have a small stroke at the edges of each letter.They create a sense of formality and elegance.
Sans-serif fonts have clean lines (no small strokes attached). They create a modern and minimalistic look.Monospace fonts 
- here all the letters have the same fixed width. They create a mechanical look. Cursive fonts imitate human handwriting.
Fantasy fonts are decorative/playful fonts.All the different font names belong to one of the generic font families.
