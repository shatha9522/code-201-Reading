 ## HTML Structure :
 In the browser window you can see a web page that features exactly
the same content as the Word document you met on the page 18. To
describe the structure of a web page, we add code to the words we want
to appear on the page.
You can see the HTML code for this page below. Don't worry about what
the code means yet. We start to look at it in more detail on the next
page. Note that the HTML code is in blue, and the text you see on screen
is in black.

 - HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.
Tags are often referred to as elements.
- Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.
- Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.
- Attributes require a name and a value.
- To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.
## Extra Marckup :
DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.
- You can add comments to your code between the
<!-- and --> markers.
- The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.
- The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.
- <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.
- The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page.
- Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.
