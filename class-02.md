## CSS
Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page.
CSS is easy to learn and understood but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document.

## WHY CSS?
CSS saves time : You can write CSS once and reuse same sheet in multiple HTML pages.
Easy Maintainence : To make a global change simply change the style, and all elements in all the webpages will be updated automatically.
Search Engines : CSS is considered as clean coding technique, which means search engines won’t have to struggle to “read” its content.
Superior styles to HTML : CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so you can give a far better look to your HTML page in comparison to HTML attributes.
Offline Browsing : CSS can store web applications locally with the help of offline catche.Using of this we can view offline websites.

## CSS Syntax

A CSS comprises of style rules that are interpreted by the browser and then applied to the corresponding elements in your document.
A style rule set consists of a selector and declaration block.
 
 Example: 
 p { 
    color: blue; 
    text-align: center; 
} 

 ## What is JavaScript?
JavaScript ("JS" for short) is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich (co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation).

- JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!
- A script is made up of a series of statements. Each
statement is like a step in a recipe.
- Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example,
you might specify that a value must be remembered
before creating a calculation using that value.
- Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of
information used in the script.
- Arrays are special types of variables that store more
than one piece of related information.
- JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9),
strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
- Expressions evaluate into a single value.
- Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.
