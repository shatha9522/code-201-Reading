## Css Transition
Transitions are the grease in the wheel of CSS transforms. Without a transition, an element being transformed would change abruptly from one state to another. By applying a transition you can control the change, making it smooth and gradual.
Each transition property can be defined individually, but for cleaner and faster code, it’s recommended that you use the transition shorthand.

The transition-property specifies the CSS property where the transition will be applied. You may apply a transition to an individual property (e.g., background-color or tranform) or to all properties in the rule-set (i.e., all).
## CSS Transform
CSS transforms - how to make an element change from one state to another. With the CSS transform property you can rotate, move, skew, and scale elements. (This post will only cover 2D transforms, but stay tuned for future blog posts on 3D transforms.)

Transforms are triggered when an element changes states, such as on mouse-hover or mouse-click. The examples in this post will demonstrate transforms on mouse-hover.

For simplicity, I’ll only be using the unprefixed versions in my examples. However, you may want to include prefixes to ensure it works in modern browsers.
