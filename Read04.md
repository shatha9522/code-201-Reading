## Linkes
The tags used to produce links are the <a> and </a>.

The <a> tells where the link should start and the </a> indicates where the link ends.

Everything between these two will work as a link.

The target of the link is added to the <a> tag using
the href="http://www.whateverpage.com" setting.

The example below shows how to make the word here work as a link to yahoo.

Click <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">here</a> to go to yahoo.


You simply:
Specify the target in the <a href=" ">.


Then add the text that should work as a link.


- Finally add an </a> tag to indicate where the link ends.
If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is
best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
- You can create links to open email programs with an
email address in the "to" field.
- You can use the id attribute to target elements within
a page that can be linked to.

## Layout 
<div> elements are often used as containing elements
to group together sections of a page.
- Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
- The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
- Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
- Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
- Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
- CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
- You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
