## What Google Learned About Teams
Google — one of the most public proselytizers of how studying workers can transform productivity — became focused on building 
the perfect team. In the last decade, the tech giant has spent untold millions of dollars measuring nearly every aspect of its employees’ lives.
 Google’s People Operations department has scrutinized everything from how frequently particular people eat together (the most productive employees 
 tend to build larger networks by rotating dining companions) to which traits the best managers share (unsurprisingly, good communication and avoiding micromanaging is critical; 
 more shocking, this was news to many Google managers).

 The company’s top executives long believed that building the best teams meant combining the best people. They embraced other bits of conventional wisdom as well, like ‘‘It’s better to put introverts together,
 ’’ said Abeer Dubey, a manager in Google’s People Analytics division, or ‘‘Teams are more effective when everyone is friends away from work.’’ But, Dubey went on, ‘‘it turned out no one had really studied which of those were true.’’
