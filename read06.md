## object
The Object class represents one of JavaScript's data types. It is used to store various keyed collections and more complex entities. Objects can be created using the Object() constructor or the object initializer / literal syntax.
The Object constructor creates an object wrapper for the given value.

If the value is null or undefined, it will create and return an empty object.
Otherwise, it will return an object of a Type that corresponds to the given value.
If the value is an object already, it will return the value.

Objects are set of variables and functions grouped together to create a model.

Variables in objects known as properties, and Functions knows as methods.

Properties and methods have a name and value and in object that name called a key, and the value can be a (string, number, boolean, array, object), and the value of a method is always a function.

We create an object by: Literal notation which is the easiest and the most popular way (write down the content between curly brackets).

To access a property or a method in an object just write down object name followed by a (dot) then the property or method name you want to access, This is known as (dot notation).

The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.

Each node is an object with methods and properties, Scripts access and update this DOM tree (not the source HTML file), Any changes made to the DOM tree are reflected in the browser.
